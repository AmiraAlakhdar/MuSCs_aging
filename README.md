# Apoptotic processes direct the matrix-induced fibrogenic conversion of aged muscle stem cells (in preperation)
---
The stiffening of the extracellular matrix (ECM) with age hinders muscle regeneration by causing intrinsic muscle stem cell (MuSC) dysfunction through a poorly understood mechanism. Here, young and aged MuSCs were seeded onto substrates engineered to mimic a soft and stiff ECM microenvironment to study those molecular changes using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA). Data revealed the presence of a branching point within the trajectory leading to the emergence of an age-related fibroblastic population characterized by activation of the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) pathway, which was significantly activated in aged cells cultured on stiff substrates. Next, using the collagen cross-linking inhibitor Î²-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) in vivo, we elucidated stiffness changes on TRAIL downstream apoptotic targets (caspase 8 and caspase 3) using immunostaining. TRAIL activity was significantly inhibited by BAPN in aged animals, indicating a complex mechanism of age-related declines in muscle function through inflammatory and apoptotic mediators.
